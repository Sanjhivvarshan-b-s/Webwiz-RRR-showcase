##  Implemented Features
I have successfully implemented the requirements for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3:

* **Visual & Responsive Design (HTML/CSS):**
    * Fully responsive layout (1-column on Mobile, 3-columns on Desktop).
    * **Slideshow Hero Section:** Smooth cross-fading background images using CSS animations.
    * **Responsive Grid Gallery:** Images are automatically cropped (`object-cover`) to fit a perfect, uniform grid layout.
    * **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Used for modern spacing, typography, and flexbox/grid layouts.

* **Interactivity (JavaScript):**
    * **Theme Switcher:** A "Fire Mode" toggle button that updates accent colors instantly.
    * **Cursor Trail:** A custom animation where red and blue sparks follow the mouse cursor.
    *  **Mobile Menu:** A functional hamburger menu for easier navigation on small screens.
    * **Interactive Cards:** Hover effects (`scale-110`) on character and gallery cards.
